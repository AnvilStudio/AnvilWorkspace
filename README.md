## Overview

Anvil Engine is a modular, developer-friendly engine built for flexibility, offering everything needed to create dynamic applications and games. It’s designed with two primary use cases in mind: high-performance game development and lightweight application development. Anvil’s structure includes a high-level layer of classes that streamline development with intuitive components and a lower-level API-specific layer for developers who need greater control over rendering and functionality.

### Key Features

- **Multi-Window Support**: Manage multiple windows seamlessly for complex applications and dynamic interfaces.
- **Customizable Renderer**: Choose between an optimized hardware renderer for performance-driven applications and a stripped-down version for lightweight projects.
- **Component-Based Architecture**: A library of components provides bare-bones elements for app development without the overhead of a full game-driven renderer.
- **High-Level and Low-Level Access**: High-level tools accelerate your workflow, while lower-level API-specific access gives you the freedom to customize as needed.
- **Built-In GLFW Support**: Integrated GLFW ensures cross-platform compatibility and handles system-level details, so you can focus on what matters most—your application’s functionality and experience.

Anvil Engine is built to serve as a comprehensive toolset that grows with your project. Whether you’re building a game or a simple app, Anvil has the flexibility and power to bring your ideas to life.
